Mastering Scrum

In our studies this semester we learned about scrum. Ken Schwaber co-developed the Scrum framework with Jeff Sutherland in the early 1990s to help organizations struggling with complex development projects. (Ken Schwaber, 2022) This framework allows for better organization, transparency, and flexibility than other methods of project management. Scrum can be implemented in any size business and the framework is incredibly power when deployed to enthusiastic teams. 

Scrum is both a framework and set of methodologies. The main driver behind scrum is the team at its heart. At the end of a project the scrum master is responsible for a retrospective for the project. Our project was to help SNHU travel develop a travel software to expand their business. Each week we took on the roll of a different member of the scrum team or learned about the methodologies that make a scrum team successful. 

The first week we took at the team charter and practices of a scrum team. In the team charter we outlined the roles of each member. The Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer and Tester roles were all given definitions and the project was launched. We received data from the client and began to rough out how each two week increment or “sprint” was to be handled. In the charter we also defined what are meetings would look like and how to communicate in a healthy manner with each other. Each person on the team is vital to successful deployment of scrum and the framework we established in the early hours of project management would guide us through the rest of the project. 

The first team member that we embodied in our studies was the product owner. The Product Owner is accountable for effective Product Backlog management which includes Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal, Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog Items, Ordering Product Backlog Items, ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood (scrum.org, 2022). The goal in this role is to understand and communicate the clients wants and needs. This role is vital to the success of the development team. Without a clear understanding of the clients needs or failing to communicate those needs will not allow the team to execute the project at a high level. This can lead to unhappy customers and wasted time and effort if the development team needs to refactor significant sections of the project. 

Next, we took on the role of the Tester. We created clear testing documents that least each step in our testing process along with the expected and actual results. This is important to the scrum team because it allows developers to quickly pivot and manage issues early into the development process. Leaving all the bug fixing and testing to the last minute is not as efficient as handling the issues early on. It also allows the product owner to give better insight into the project. Understand and communicating the issues and expectations of the software to the rest of the team aids the developers in creating a better product early. Communication transparency add a lot of value to the product and every team member is important to ensuring that we deliver that to the clients. 

Next, we took on the role of the developer. We were hit with a large curveball in development when SNHU Travel adjusted their needs. They pivoted to a more specific piece of software. The scope narrowed to health and wellness vacations. In this stage we refactored our code for the more specific requirements. There was very little wasted effort because of the modular nature of our project management framework. Scrum allowed us to continue working almost as if the requirements did not change. 

Lastly, we worked on our communication skills and practices alongside exploring some project management tools. We dove into how we should communicate clearly, use methods of communication with high accountability and create visualizations of a progress and product backlog/user stories. Communicating clearly and in an accountable fashion allows the team to reduce sprawl and scope creep. Visualizations provide even more transparency on the progress of project. The project management tools are a great asset to any project. Personally, I love tools that allow you to track each task and leave notes about its progress. Seeing the tasks all turn green and moving them to a completed section is very satisfying as it is creating interactive visualizations of my hard work. 

Overall, I believe scrum to be an asset to development on this project. The solid organizational framework from the very beginning provided a flexible platform to build off. The roles in the team help keep each person focused on completing the tasks they are most successful working on. When we had to pivot the framework was already in place to make changes with the minimum of effort. If we had taken the waterfall approach much more time and effort would have been wasted. In the waterfall approach we would have developed the entire program and had to refactor much of it. 

In retrospective the scrum approach worked well for this project. Good communication, flexibility, and a transparent understanding of what needed to be done carried the day. In the future I will recommend taking this approach with most projects I conduct. The level of understanding and organization at each level is an asset to completion.
